### Smart Thermostat - deCONZ
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FKartoffelToby%2FHome-Assistant-Setup%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fhomeassistant%2Fsmart_thermostat.yaml)
```
The most deCONZ Zigbee TVR have an internal Temperature sensor. The fact that this sensor ist located direct to the radiator will generated false measurements. To fix this this blueprint uses an external temperature sensor and adjust the offset of the Thermostat to match the room temperature, it also will be linkt to an External window sensor group to turn off the heating if a window is open. And also turns off if a specific outside temperature is reached to avoid heating in summer
